## `felayout_t3kit` includes CSS and JS source files for theme_t3kit project.

1. `felayout_t3kit` works closely with t3kit docker, so to start developing using felayout we need to [install and run t3kit using docker configuration](https://github.com/t3kit/t3kit#development)


2. Next step we need disable default styling (CSS) and JS scripts in t3kit to be able to insert it (CSS/JS) dynamically from felayout_t3kit. For this, we need to change `FElayout mode` constant from `less` to `development`.
   * TYPO3 BE -> tab `Themes` -> `Expert` -> `FElayout mode`

3. Next step is to run local server (_proxied from t3kit TYPO3 installation_) `localhost:9001` wich includes all CSS/LESS/JS files (`theme_t3kit/felayout_t3kit/dev`) with livereloading. For this, we need to use command `grunt`.

4. Last step. After all changes (CSS/LESS/JS) which you did in `felayout` you will need to compile FE files into `theme_t3kit/Resources/Public/css` or `theme_t3kit/Resources/Public/less` folder using comands: `grunt compileCss` or `grunt compileLess`. Also, keep in mind that these compilated files should be committed by separate commit with a message `update css/less` without any prefixes. [Commit messages without prefixes shouldn't go to changelog files](https://github.com/t3kit/t3kit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#labels). **Do not commit compilated files together with source files from `theme_t3kit/felayout_t3kit/dev`**



### Grunt commands:

- Run `grunt` to start local server (_proxied from t3kit TYPO3 installation_) with livereload `localhost:9001`
- Run `grunt check` to check CSS (.stylelintrc) and JS (JS standard) files according code conventions.
- Run `grunt compileCss` or `grunt cc` to compile all Front-End service files plus **CSS** styling for **t3kit** needs and copy it to `theme_t3kit/Resources/Public/css` folder.
- Run `grunt compileLess` or `grunt cl` to compile all Front-End service files plus **LESS** styling for **t3kit** needs, copy it to it to `theme_t3kit/Resources/Public/less` folder.
